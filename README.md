# Assignment 1: Leeds Studio Projector Configuration System

## Overview

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a program that would create a pixel configuration for the projector set up in Leeds Studio. This involved creating a mapping of the 6 projector screens pixel values to the physical space.

We chose to use Processing to develop the UI and store the pixel values in a JSON file upon completion of the user's mapping. Python was then used with various libraries (TODO: specify Python libraries). Below are further details about the UI, an explanation of the mapping of pixels to physical space, and a use case for these values in the form of a video processing module.

## Semi-Automatic Program: User Interface

TODO: @Mary include in description:

- Video of the demo performed in CCAM
- Explanation of the console prompts and general workflow
- Mentioning that the UI directs the user to have the numbers in ascending order from left to right
- Hotkeys throughout the module

## File Output: Pixels to Physical Space Mapping

TODO: @Maansi include in this description

- Explanation of the file format
- Diagram of sample JSON points and where they exist in the physical space
- Final results of the mapping program (either screen_coords or screen_config, but preferably screen_coords since those numbers are taken directly from the projector)

## Use Case: Video Processing Module

TODO: @Cody include in description

- Explanation of how the Processing script output can be used to translate videos to be properly displayed across the projectors
- Identify various libraries used
- Talk about program being dynamic and not only specific to this projector set up
