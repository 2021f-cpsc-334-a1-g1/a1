# Intro to Processing
Welcome to the wonderful world of the Processing language :)

## Download
In order to execute Processing scripts, you have to download the Processing IDE from their [official website](https://processing.org/).

### Processing 4 Download

- [Mac OS X](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/download/processing-1276-4.0b1/processing-4.0b1-macosx.zip)
- [Windows (64bit)](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/download/processing-1276-4.0b1/processing-4.0b1-windows64.zip)
- [Linux (64bit)](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases/download/processing-1276-4.0b1/processing-4.0b1-linux64.tgz)

*Note: If we would rather use Processing 3, that's fine with me. The difference between Processing 3 is that 3 uses Java 8, whereas Processing 4 uses Java 11. I'm good either way*

## Quickstart
If you want a soft introduction to Processing, they provide a pretty digestable introduction lesson [on their website](https://hello.processing.org/editor/) that walks you through a bit of the language and set up.

The file within this directory was just my attempt to show how wonderful processing is :) And also is a start at a practical use for Processing for our purposes. 

If you want to test it out, then you can open the file in Processing, press run, and voila! There should be an window that pops up that has similar functionality to this GIF when you mouse over it:

The window currently matches the aspect ratio that the projector screens have (I believe Professor Petersen said in class that the projectors mapped to a 4000x768 screen?) just as a sort of visual starting point.

Anyways, that's all I have on Processing for now! Message me with questions
